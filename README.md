# Basketball Dream Team Calculator

Welcome to the Basketball Dream Team Calculator!

The Dream Team Calculator is a fun app used to determine what would be the greatest of all time (GOAT) basketball team, if you were able to choose from the greatest players of all time. The metrics used for each player are their points per game (PPG), rebounds per game (RPG), assists per game (APG) and the championships (rings) they won throughout their career. These metrics are calculated by adding up the points each player earns, with each team being comprised of 2 guards, 2 forwards & 1 center.

Below is the points breakdown:
* PPG: 7x their original amount
* RPG: 4x their original amount
* APG: 5x their original amount
* Championships: 10x their original amount
            
Have fun creating the greatest team of all time!
